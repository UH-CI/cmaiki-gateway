## C-MAIKI Gateway

The C-MAIKI 

In collaboration with the Center for Microbiome Analysis through Island Knowledge and Investigations (C-MAIKI), the Hawaii EPSCoR Ike Wai project and the Hawaii Data Science Institute, a new science gateway, the C-MAIKI gateway, was developed to support modern, interoperable and scalable microbiome data analysis. This gateway provides a web-based interface for accessing high-performance computing resources and storage to enable and support reproducible microbiome data analysis. The C-MAIKI gateway is accelerating the analysis of microbiome data for Hawaii through ease of use and centralized infrastructure.

This version of the web application is implemented as a client-side application using the [AngularJS framework](http://angularjs.org/). It is designed to run entirely within your browser with no need for a back-end server. The Aside from the Tapis Platform itself, there are no external third-party service dependencies. The assets produced by this project are entirely static, thus you may host this application out of your Bitbucket, GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive, or even a folder you published using Agave.
